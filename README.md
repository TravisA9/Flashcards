# [Flashcards](https://travisa9.github.io/Flashcards/)
Various interative language learning tools   ...mainly for Myanmar language at the moment.

I will make things work as I get the audios I need. I am making this for my own sake at this point. That's ussually the best reason to make something anyways. But it also means that I will probably add things at a rate that corresponds to my own learning ...unless I find reason to do otherwise. 

### You can find the following:

* **Myanmar letter/number flashcards**: You can specifically select whichever letter/number groups you want to practice learning.
* **Listening Meter**: This is a very simple option, but don't be fooled! It is en excelent way to get way more out of listening to foreign languages. Just list the words you want to listen for seperated by commas (EX: Good, Hello, Thank You, Brother, Family), click the button and a set of counters will be generated for you. Now you can just peck at the buttons while you listen and they will keep count for you. If you have friends it becomes a competative sport :)
* **Word practice**: Practice word flashcards this is a good second step for learning to read.
* **Sentence builder**: Now that you know a bunch of words, this would be great for learning to put them together into sentences ...if I had it finished.


To toggle functionality you need to go to the blue 'Mode' menu item and select the option you need.
